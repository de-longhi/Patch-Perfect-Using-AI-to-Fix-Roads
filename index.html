            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The task is simple: You are provided with 500 images of potholes and a label for each pothole, 
                telling you the amount of cement that was used to fill said pothole. Write a model that can 
                predict the amount of cement needed to fill a pothole given a new image. Each pothole in the images
                has a stick with marks 500mm apart on it to aid you in knowing the real life size of the pothole.
                Included with the labels, are co-ordinates (in yolo format) of bounding boxes around potholes and the
                sticks on the potholes. The main problem of the project is finding a way to create a rough estimate of 
                the real life area of the pothole, using the stick annotations and images.

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>The following is a description of our final solution and will not include any previous solutions we explored.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: x-large;">The pipeline:</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/pipeline.png" alt="Data School Hackathon" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 750px;">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Semantic Segmentation of the potholes and sticks:</strong> After hours of hand-drawn annotations of the 
                potholes we finally had annotated, segmented images. This includes labels for "stick" and "pothole". We then used a
                torchvision FCN model and fine tuned it for our segmentation. We also applied data augmentation and a learning rate
                scheduler.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Object Detection of L1 and L2:</strong> Using the provided labels of the sticks over the potholes, we 
                fine tuned a yolov5 model by freezing the first few layers and training the model on our data.</li>
                <li><strong>Approximation of the pothole area in pixels:</strong> After performing segmentation, there is a gap in
                the estimated mask of the pothole because of the stick. Because of this, we add a fraction of the amount of pixels 
                in the stick to the calculated pothole area (depending on the area of the stick relative to the pothole).
                This gives us an estimation of the amount of pixels that belongs to the pothole.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pixel to millimeter Conversion: </strong> Using the width of L1 and L2, we calculate the real-life
                area of the pothole. The width of L1 is 500mm in real life.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Regression: </strong> Finally, using the real real-life area of the pothole, we fit a generalized additive
                model to predict the amount of cement needed to fill the pothole.</li>

            <h2>Bonus Question</h2>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Now that you have built a model to predict how much asphalt is required to fill a pothole based on just
                images, how might you commercialise this model? How can your model be used practically in industry?</p>
            <p><strong>Our Answer:</strong> TODO</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In the end, although our solution might not be optimal, this challenge was extremely fun and we learned more than we have in years.
               We extend our gratitude greatly to the organizers of the hackathon, Stellenbosch University and Standard Bank.
